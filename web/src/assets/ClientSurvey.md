>How does this site compare to your expectations?

Very much exceeded my expectations! I had expected some exploratory work that would show a good way forward, but in fact the outcome is attractive & user-friendly, and can almost be dropped straight into our existing race tracker. It also revealed some gaps & flaws in the data (which can now be addressed).

>Do you think this site adequately represents your organisation and the race?

Yes.

>Where you happy with our level of communication and contactability?

Yes, I met with the whole team on a couple of occasions and worked frequently with Cholena to make sure our data API was working appropriately. This helped me to fix a couple of problem spots in our data I wasn't aware of before.

>What features do you like?

Interactive charts, visualisation of patterns not previously available to the end user.

>What features could you live without?

none

>What features would you like to see changed?

none

>Do you have any ideas for future developments?

This is just the beginning... I'm looking forward to integrating this and expanding the repertoire of visualisations on our site.
